# Hi there, I'm Cássio Barth! 👋
### Data Engineer & Researcher | MSc in Ethnomusicology

I am a **Data Engineer in training** with a strong background in **Academic Research**. After 10+ years analyzing complex musical patterns as an Ethnomusicologist, I now apply that analytical rigor to **Big Data, ETL pipelines, and Neuroscience**.

Currently, I am diving deep into code at **42 Barcelona** (Piscine Candidate) and developing AI solutions for Neurodiversity.
